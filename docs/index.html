<h1>Unundulu</h1>

<p>
I am Unundulu and I have come to this world to show the possibilities of FM sound sources. 
I am exploring and making music as an intelligent life form on earth. 
Our proposal of Interruptive Sequence (the latest technology!) is a revolutionary method that maximizes the power of FM sound sources. No one in this world knows about this technique yet. You, who are reading this, know it now. There is no going back.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
I came into this world to show the possibilities of FM sound sources. Don't make me say it twice.
I know you are wondering about Interruptive Sequence, and I agree with you.
I don't know much about it myself, but I heard that it means to make a song so that the notes don't overlap on a single track.
If you think it's too hard, give it a try! You'll be able to make strange music very easily.
</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>
I have prepared for you, the very kind and generous me, an mp3 file that you can listen to in a nutshell, for the sake of your busy schedule.
For now, you can listen for free. The pay-per-view is just around the corner. Now is your chance! Oh, we have to hurry!
